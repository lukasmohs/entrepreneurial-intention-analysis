Due to the economic importance of entrepreneurship, the research interest in the field of \acl{ee} has increased significantly. Building on the discussion of whether entrepreneurs are born or made, this study assesses the role of \acl{ee} for \acl{ei} by evaluating the impact of a university \acl{ec} on \acl{ei}. Two distinct research questions will be answered. First, we partially reconfirm the widely accepted theory that the antecedents of Ajzen's \acl{tpb} predict \acl{ei}. Second, we assess whether the antecedents mediate the effect of \aclp{ec} on \acl{ei}. This study uses an ex-post research design of a cross-sectional dataset. Our findings contribute to the \acl{tpb}, however, we find a negative and insignificant effect of \aclp{ee} on \acl{ei}. Thus, no mediation effect can be observed.
